# Loadb

Loadb is a tool that helps to automates with the process if testing your application for loads.

Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

Modern highâ€‘traffic websites must serve hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of concurrent requests from users or clients and return the correct text, images, video, or application data, all in a fast and reliable manner.

For your application to stand the test of time it is of importance for the application to be able to carry most of the loads coming in from requests. 

This simple tool is basically for testing your nodejs apps while developing to help reduce the stress of testing for load and also reducing the curve of leaning about load testing tools.
