# QuickGist Web Forum

QuickGist is a web based chat application which allows unique users to join a chat room/group
and chat/discuss about random topics in real-time. QuickGist allows users connect with ease because there is no authentication built into the application, all that is required to join a group is a unique username. 

The focus of the application is to allow users to engage in "quick" discussions in a modest and decent manner, hence, foul languages or profane words are censored.
 
QuickGist is a single-page application (SPA), it was developed with some of the most popular web technologies on the web.
